    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Sambal terasi is an Indonesian chili paste made primarily from fresh red
      chilies and fermented shrimp paste known as terasi. It is one of the most
      common and widely used sambals across Indonesia and serves as a versatile
      condiment that accompanies a variety of dishes, from fried fish and
      vegetables to rice and tofu.
    </p>
    <p>
      The key ingredient, terasi, is made from ground, salted, and fermented
      small shrimp that is sun-dried and either formed into blocks or sold
      loose. Before being used in sambal, terasi is typically toasted or fried
      to reduce its strong odor and enhance its umami flavor.
